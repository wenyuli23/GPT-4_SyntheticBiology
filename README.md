This study presents a proof-of-concept workflow that leverages GPT AI to extract data from academic articles focused on the industrial yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica. The extracted data facilitates machine learning and transfer learning methods, to accurately predict outcome variables, such as titer, from unseen data based on varying strain designs, culture medium, and bioreactor conditions. Transfer Learning (TL) can expedite research on the less-studied yeast, thereby predicting product titers for *Rhodosporidium toruloides* with different numbers of heterologous genes.

All data extracted during this project have been made publicly available [here](impact-database.com). The codebase for modeling can be accessed in each subdirectories. This initiative aims to foster transparency, replicability, and further advancements in the field.

## System Requirements
For a complete list of requirements to run all algorithms, please see requirements.txt. A separate virtual environment is recommended. All code was developed and tested with Python 3.7.

## Installation
